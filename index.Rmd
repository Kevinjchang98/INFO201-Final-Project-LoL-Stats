# Introduction
This project will perform analysis on League of Legends data. It will provide an in-depth analysis of a particular player's recent statistics based upon their most recent 100 games, as well as provide more meta-level analysis comparing trends of the player base as a whole over a larger period of time. Any such insights obtained here can very easily be recreated for any player given the flexibility of the API.

## Problem Domain
